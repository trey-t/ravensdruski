But your volleyball game is hilariously short.
You swing at the ball and it goes out of bounds,
Your serve hits the net and makes terrible sounds.

You call for the set but you trip on your feet,
Every spike you attempt is a glorious defeat.
The ball hits your face, your arms, and your head,
At this point just go play badminton instead.

You bump it too high, you bump it too low,
Your teammates all wonder where did their hope go.
But hey, keep on trying, you beautiful mess,
At least you showed up... even if you're the less.`;

Your nuts smell like a dumpster behind a seafood restaurant in August. They smell like if a skunk ate nothing but boiled eggs and asparagus for a month. The Geneva Convention is considering adding your nuts as a banned chemical weapon.

NASA detected the stench from the International Space Station. Dogs refuse to sniff you. Febreze quit. Glade filed a restraining order.

Bro please, for the love of humanity, for the sake of everyone who has ever been downwind of you — WASH. YOUR. NUTS. The world is begging you. The ozone layer can't take much more of this.`;
