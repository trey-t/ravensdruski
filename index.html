`Ben. We need to talk about your volleyball game. It is genuinely, historically, impressively bad. Like you somehow get worse every single time you play. Your serve looks like you're swatting a fly and the ball barely clears your own side of the net — if it even leaves your hand at all. Your bumps go in every direction except where they're supposed to go. You shank the easiest passes straight into the ceiling.

Your sets look like you're trying to juggle with oven mitts on. When you go up for a spike, the ball somehow ends up behind you. You've been blocked by people a full foot shorter than you. Your digs are just you falling on the ground and the ball landing two feet away.

Your teammates have to cover your entire zone because nobody trusts you to touch the ball. When you rotate to the front row, your whole team gets nervous. You call "mine" and everyone holds their breath because they know it's about to go sideways. Literally sideways.

You are, without question, the worst volleyball player anyone has ever seen. And that's not an exaggeration. That is a fact.`;

`Oh Connor... where do we even begin. Bro, your nuts STINK. Like we need to have a serious conversation about this. The moment you walk into a room, people's eyes start watering and they don't even know why yet. Scientists have tried to classify the smell but their equipment keeps breaking.

Your nuts smell like a dumpster behind a seafood restaurant in August. They smell like if a skunk ate nothing but boiled eggs and asparagus for a month. The Geneva Convention is considering adding your nuts as a banned chemical weapon.

NASA detected the stench from the International Space Station. Dogs refuse to sniff you. Febreze quit. Glade filed a restraining order.

Bro please, for the love of humanity, for the sake of everyone who has ever been downwind of you — WASH. YOUR. NUTS. The world is begging you. The ozone layer can't take much more of this.`;

`Trey. THE Trey. Where do we even start with this man. First of all, Trey is absolutely, disgustingly rich. We're talking money on top of money on top of more money. His bank account has bank accounts. He doesn't check his balance because the number is so long it crashes the app. His wallet is so thick it has its own gravitational pull.

But it's not just the money. Trey is legitimately one of the coolest human beings to ever walk the earth. He walks into a room and the temperature drops because he's THAT cool. People don't introduce themselves to Trey — they audition. Sunglasses wear Trey.

And FUNNY? This man is the funniest person alive and it's not even close. Stand-up comedians study his texts. He once told a joke so funny that three people had to go to the hospital. He doesn't laugh at other people's jokes because nothing is funnier than what's already in his head.

On top of all that, Trey is just flat out awesome at everything he does. Sports? Elite. Video games? Unbeatable. Style? Immaculate. Every outfit is a statement. Every move is calculated perfection. He was born winning and never stopped.

If you know Trey, you're lucky. If Trey knows YOU, you've already peaked in life. There is nobody on this planet who comes close. Trey is the blueprint. The standard. The GOAT. And that's not up for debate.`;
